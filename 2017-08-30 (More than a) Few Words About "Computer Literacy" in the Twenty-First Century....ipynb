    "\n",
    "    our_counts = Counter(our_list_of_results)\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter then gives you what is essentially a two-column table \"our_counts\": The first column is a list of all the things that Counter found in our_list_of_results—all the outcomes. The second column is the number of times each of those outcomes appeared in our_list_of_results. Thus if you feed Counter this list of die rolls:\n",
    "\n",
    "    our_list_of_results = [1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Counter will give us:\n",

    "    our_counts = {\n",

    "        4: 1   \n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "By some abuse of language, we then do not say: \"'our_counts' is what is returned by the Counter function applied to 'our_list_of_results'\". We say, instead: \"'our_counts' is a Counter object\". \n",
    "\n",
    "IMHO, \"object\" is a bad word to people who are not already object-oriented computer programmers. Think, instead: \"Counter\" is a Python program somebody has already written. It takse a list, and burps back a table (a \"dict\" or \"dictionary\" data structure in Python) that tells us what outcomes are in the list and how many times each outcome is in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the language programmers of Python have already done the work of creating the \"Counter\" class and including it in the \"collections\" module makes our work here much, much easier. We are going to roll our (virtual) dice a million times. Counting up the outcomes would be tedious, if not for \"Counter\".\n",
    "\n",

If you have ever played Dungeons & Dragons, you know what I am talking about. Suppose I select a die from the box at random, roll it, and truthfully report to you that I get a 6. What is the probability that I rolled each die?\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Downey solves this via creative thought and clever programming, using Python's object-oriented language structure. But we are, first, going to solve it much more easily and quickly—in literally five minutes of time spent programming—using what we might as well call: Brute Force and Massive Ignorance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to present you with both ways because they together nearly span the ways we interact with computers: getting them to do lots of really simply and dumb calculations really fast, and keeping track of the results, on the one hand; building and keeping track of very complex, sophisticated, and clever chains of reasoning, on the other. It is useful to see both sides. (And this was how I originally started to learn this stuff in AM 110 in the spring of 1979: we worked close to the bare metal of the DEC PDP-11/70 via Assembly language on the one hand; we worked as far from the bare metal as was then possible with LISP on... well... in theory, at least, it did not matter what it was on on the other hand.) What I call BFMI is not Assembly, but it is not far. The type of Python Allen Downey writes is not LISP, but it is not far either...)"

    "That took about 15 minutes of my time: five minutes to program up the million dice rolls (the program ran first time—that almost never happens) and then count, sort, and divide to produce the odds table; five more minutes to add the comments to the main program; and a last five minutes to look up how to print out the ugly version of the odds table just above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh. And computer time? Cells [1], [2], and [4] saw the computer came back finished before I could think of what to do next. Cell [3] took about 6 seconds to run on my machine (13\" MacBookAir, Early 2015; 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7; 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3; C1MPQ2QJG944).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this table is not exactly right. The first four rows should be _identical_: the only information we get from a die roll of 1-4 is \"this roll could have been produced by any of the dice\". Similarly, rows 5-6 (\"this roll could have been produced by any except the 4-sided die\"), rows 7-8 (\"this roll could not have been produced by the 4- or by the 6-sided die\"), rows 9-12 (\"this roll could only have been produced by the 12- or the 20-sided die), and rows 13-20 (\"yup: the die rolled has more than 12 sides\") should be identical. But they are not quite. (Even a ten million rolls run would still leave occasional jiggles up or down by 0.1% in som elements of the table: I tried it, and it took the computer a minute. If I wanted to nail the numbers—have CLT convergence down to the last tenth of a percentage point—I would have to let the microprocessor spend as much time running it as I spent programming it: 15 minutes or so and five hundred million rolls.)\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we grasp what is going on in this odds table? Rows 13-20 are simple: one of the dice has been chosen and rolled, and the number rolled is one that could only have been rolled by the 20-sided die. So the chance the 20-sided die was the one chosen and rolled is 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is going on in rows 9-12? A die is chosen, and the resulting roll could not have been made by the 4-, the 6-, or the 8-sided die. We thus understand why the first three numbers in each line are: 0%, 0%, 0%: we know that either the 12- and 20-sided die was the one chosen. But we know that each had an equal chance of being chosen. So why are the last two numbers not 50%, 50% but instead 62.5%, 37.5%? Because we know more than just that the die roll could not have been made by any of the 4-, 6-, or 8-sided dice. We also know, in addition, that _if_ the 20-sided die were chosen _then_ it gave us a relatively unlikely relatively low roll: a 9-12 and not the 13-20 that would have been more likely had we known only (a) that the 20-sided die were chosen and (b) that it rolled a number greater than 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more concrete: 1/5 of the time the 12-sided die is rolled. 1/3 of the time that the 12-sided die is rolled, the result is a 9-12. Thus (a) 12-sided die and (b) 9-12 occurs 1/5 x 1/3 = 1/15 of the time a die is rolled. 1/5 of the time the 20-sided die is rolled. 1/5 of the time that the 20-sided die is rolled the result is a 9-12. Thus (a) 12-sided die and (b) 9-12 occurs 1/5 x 1/5 = 1/25 of the time a die is rolled. Seeing a 9-12 thus takes place 1/15 + 1/25 = 8/75 of the time—3/75 with a 20- and 5/75 with a 5-sided die. Hence 37.5% and 62.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "These arguments _sound_ convincing. But how do we know they are really right? How do we know that this is the way things work? We know because we rolled the (virtual) dice a million times. 5/8 of the time that a 9-12 was rolled, the die doing the rolling was the 12-sided die; only 3/8 of the time was the die doing the rolling the 20-sided die."

    ">Suppose I have a box of dice that contains a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 12-sided die, and a 20-sided die, each of them with sides labeled from 1 on up sequentially. If you have ever played Dungeons & Dragons, you know what I am talking about. Suppose I select a die from the box at random, roll it, and truthfully report to you that I get a 6. What is the probability that I rolled each die?\n",

    "\n",
    "First, Allen Downey of Olin College extends Counter—building it into what we will here call a \"ProbabilityMass\" by adding a \"normalize\" to it so that what it will contain (after \"normalize\") is not counts but rather frequencies that sum to one—probabilities, in other words. Then he extends ProbabilityMass, building it into what he calls a \"Suite\"—a suite, that is, of the subjective Bayesian probabilities of complete and non-overlapping hypotheses about the world. He does so by adding a \"bayesian_update\" function that takes a piece of data and uses it to update the Bayesian probabilities of the hypotheses in the Suite if you know the likelihoods of the data appearing under each of the hyptheses. Last, he extends Suite, building it into what he calls a \"DiceSuite\", by adding on a function calculating the likelihood that a particular roll was made by a certain die given how many sides the die has: "

    "### Discussion: Why Do Things Downey's—the _Pythonic_—Way?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I do not know about you, but that took me not fifteen minutes but more like six hours: to copy the program logic from Allen Downey's github repository, poke around it until I felt that I understood its logic well enough to explain it, modify it so it prints out the whole table of results rather than just line 6, and then write this up. It would have taken me a lot more than six hours if I had had to come up with it rather than just follow along in the footsteps of Allen Downey's _Think Bayes_ <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it took you significantly less time, then congratulations: you have a bring future ahead of you in high-paying jobs working as an object-oriented computer programmer!\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the reasons to do things Downey's way—a style of programming that is object-oriented, Pythonic, using clever data structures, the theoretical insight of statistics developed by the Rev. Thomas Bayes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac {P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and other such intellectual tools, rather than \"let's roll a million (virtual) dice and see\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, Allen Downey now has a suite of tools that he can easily adapt to answer related—and more complicated questions. What if you want to know: \"What are the probabilities if my counterparty rolls 3, 6, 4, 2, 5, 4, 3\"? What if you want to know: \"How many die rolls do I need to see—none of which are above 12—before I can conclude that it is highly, highly unlikely that the die chosen is the twenty-sided die?\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, sooner or later BFMI fails because you do not have enough brute force at your disposal. Suppose you had not one but 100 dice rolls, and not one but 100 possible ways that the initial box from which the die is chosen could be set up. We are now—if you want to nail the probabilities to even one decismal place—talking about not fifteen minutes but 2500 hours of computer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Third, even in the best of cases, BFMI—let's simulate it a lot of times and see what happens—requires that you know a simple thing to simulate, and the kind of knowledge behind what Downey is doing is the only thing that makes setting up the right simple thing to simulate many times possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fourth, after programming it up, someone doing it Allen Downey's way would understand and could explain why the numbers are what they are in a way that somebody doing it the BRMI way could not. Recall the discussion beginning \"How should we grasp what is going on in this odds table?\" above: I had to bolt that onto the BFMI run in order to give you a chance of gaining some insight into the situation. Somebody doing it Allen Downey's way would have to learn and understand that discussion already before they could finish programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fifth, the BFMI way makes my students cry, because my code reads as though it was badly translated from the FORTRAN computer language written over 1953-1957 by John Backus, Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#History>. "

I know many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by strength. As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was _ghâsh_: that is “fire”. Then something came into the chamber–I felt it through the door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door left my control and began to open! I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down the stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think…'\n",

At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. ‘If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them’, he said. ‘I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin…’"

I have written a class called Pmf that uses a Python dictionary in exactly that way, and provides a number of useful methods. I called the class Pmf in reference to a probability mass function, which is a way to represent a distribution mathematically. Pmf is defined in a Python module I wrote....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The following code builds a Pmf to represent the distribution of outcomes for a six-sided die:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pmf = Pmf()\n",

    ">Pmf creates an empty Pmf with no values. The Set method sets the probability associated with each value to 1/6.... Pmf provides a method, Normalize....\n",
    "\n",
    "        pmf.Normalize()....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Pmf uses a Python dictionary to store the values and their probabilities [note: this is confusing: the \"values\" of the random variable are the \"keys\" to the dictionary object; and the probabilities are the \"values\" of the dictionary object], so the values in the Pmf can be any hashable type. The probabilities can be any numerical type, but they are usually floating-point numbers....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Now that we see what elements of the framework are the same [for these problems], we can encapsulate them in an object—a Suite is a Pmf that provides __init__, Update, and Print:\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Suite(Pmf):\n",

A concrete type is a class that extends an abstract parent class and provides an implementation of the missing methods....\n",
